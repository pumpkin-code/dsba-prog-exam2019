/*!
 * \brief Function loads data about employees from a given input stream \a istr,
 * creates a collection of employees related to strings in the stream and
 * returns it.
 *
 * \param istr an input stream.
 * \return a collection of employees filled up with data read from a given
 * stream.
 *
 * A collection of employees is represented by a map of NameEmployeeMap type
 * (see solut.h for the definition). Each record about employees is
 * represented by a single line (ended with '\n') and gets its corresponding
 * element in the map. The key of a map's element is an employee's name, the
 * value is an Employee object. Note, for an object
 *      Employee empl
 * its member field "name" (empl.name) is equal to the key.
 *
 * A given stream (highly likely represented by a text file) provides one
 * employee record per line. A line consists of:
 *  - employee's name (string)
 *  - department (string)
 *  - position (string)
 *  - boss (string)
 *  - working days (sequence of strings)
 * All strings are limited in length and do not exceed 100 characters.
 * The attributes within a single line are separated by tab characters ('\t').
 *
 * The empty line occurred in the stream means the input completion.
 *
 * Employee name and boss name strings can contain spaces.
 *
 * Example:
 *      Caius Mueller→acc→fellow→Lila Haigh→Tue→Thu→Fri
 *      ...
 *      Lila Haigh→acc→mngr→Jeffery Amos→Mon→Tue→Thu→Fri→Sat
 *      ...
 *
 * WARNING: here we use → character to depict a tab character '\t'. Do not
 * use it (→) in your program!!!
 *
 * The number of working days for each employee may vary and is not known in
 * advance.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to decompose the method properly. Solve each
 * subtasks by using individual functions.

 *
 * Function makes a map (of type DepartEmplMap) where a key represents a
 * department name (string) and the corresponding value represents a set of
 * employee names (StrSet) working in the department.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *      "acc" → { "Caius Mueller", "Chantal Shannon", "Jeffery Amos",
 *                "Lila Haigh" }
 *      ...

 * \brief Function outputs information about employees distributed by
 * departments into a given stream.
 *
 * \param ostr is a stream for outputting.
 * \param depList is a collection of employees (by their names) distributes by
 * departments. E.g., such a map can be obtained as a result of
 * selectEmployeesInDepartents() function.
 * \param team is a map of employees (e.g. created by loadData() function).
 *
 * Cost: »»»0.35«««
 *
 * Function outputs a department name and then a set of employees working in
 * the department. Employees are output using the following rules:
 *  - the alphabetical order of employee names is used;
 *  - one employee per line preceded by a tab ('\t') character;
 *  - the employee's name is succeded by the employee's position, separated by
 *    a comma with a space; then a semicolon character with a space, followed by
 *    a number of working days with "w/d" suffix.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * acc
 *    →    Caius Mueller, fellow; 3 w/d
 *    →    Chantal Shannon, fellow; 3 w/d
 *   ...
 * office
 *    →    Reese Craft, head; 5 w/d
 *   ...
 *
 * Hint: use team to collect all necessary data about an employee.
